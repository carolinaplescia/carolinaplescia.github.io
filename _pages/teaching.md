The overarching goal of my teaching is to develop studentsâ€™ critical capacities and transferable skills
that they could use in their lives and careers well beyond the subject taught.
I support the process of inclusive and critical learning through a variety of teaching resources
and strategies in particular: critical thinking, interactive teaching, listen to the learners and inclusive and positive environment.

I have in the past attended several workshops and training events to formally and 
informally strengthen my teaching abilities for instance I received the Diploma for teaching with the 
Centre for Academic Practice and Student Learning (CAPSL) at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.

I am very happy to share syllabi and any other teaching material so feel free to contact me anytime!
