In this research I study retrospective voting namely whether and how citizens use voting during elections
to punish or reward their representatives. I focus specifically on the bias that citizens might have when evaluating the work of their representatives
but also how political institutions moderate the working of the accountability mechanism. I tend to rely on 
existing datasets to answers research questions related to retrospective voting but I have designed new questions and survey experiments to
go beyond what is currently already know from the existing literature.
